# Project2
This is my second group project from my FinTech Bootcamp. The project involves using machine learning to predict breakouts in Disney stocks. The beginning of the code is taking the Disney stocks and putting the breakout stocks into their own variable and after that using different models and classifiers to make predictions.

The first file, Project2, is a rough draft code with the classifier I chose, XGBoost. And the second file, group2_book, is the code where we all collaborated our classifiers together.
